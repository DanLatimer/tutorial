# Setup

Install Node https://nodejs.org/en/download
Download project (using git or download the project as a zip file from the github webpage)
Open a command prompt, move to the directory of the project
enter the server directory, run the command line command `npm run start`
open another command prompt, move to the directory of the project
enter the client directory, run the command line command `npm run start`

This should open a web brower and display the webpage, it will auto reload when the files change

Open the files using any text editor but I'd recommend downloading VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Make changes and save and the page will update.
